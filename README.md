Aardvark.Media provides high-performance applications and purely functional application programming for graphics and user interfaces. It brings together 3D graphics, user interfaces, and complex interactions with the [ELM](https://elm-lang.org/) architecture, which makes declarative, reliable UI and app development easier. Aardvark.Media supports interactions with objects in 3D renderings, just like buttons in elm or [Elmish](https://elmish.github.io/elmish/). In Aardvark.Media, changes are computed on the model, allowing incrementally updating optimized scene representations for 3D rendering. The library runs on netcore and sites are served using [suave](https://suave.io/) or [Giraffe](https://github.com/giraffe-fsharp/Giraffe). Rendering supports OpenGL and Vulkan. Applications typically use the electron-based [aardium](https://github.com/aardvark-community/aardium) for client-side application deployment or full server-side application deployment. Experimental support for client-side deployment using [fable](https://fable.io/) exists. Aardvark.Mediaâ€™s server-side approach is particularly useful in remote-rendering scenarios.

You can find demos and code in the Gallery and Packages&Repositories links above. Additionally, examples are available in the  `src/Examples*` folder in this repository. For more information, please refer to the [aardvark.docs wiki](https://github.com/aardvark-platform/aardvark.docs/wiki).

Aardvark.Media is part of the open-source [Aardvark Platform](https://github.com/aardvark-platform) for visual computing, real-time graphics, and visualization. Aardvark.Media builds on basic data structures and tools from [Aardvark.Base](https://github.com/aardvark-platform/aardvark.base). High-performance 3D rendering is provided by [Aardvark.Rendering](https://github.com/aardvark-platform/aardvark.rendering).
